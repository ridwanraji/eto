# ETO

## Project Description
```
When it comes to job application, there are a few problems that job applicants face:
1. People with so many skills often have to switch things up in their resume to fit 
the job description every time they are applying for jobs. After some time, it's hard 
to keep track of the jobs you've applied for and how many changes you've made to the 
informations you submitted when applying.
2. Some job posting get deleted as soon as the posting is closed. And in the case 
you get a call for an interview at a job you applied for but can't even remember when 
you applied for it or what the job posting was asking for or how to prepare for the 
interview.

This kind of problems is what ETO is striving to solve. ETO helps track, save and 
allow you to manage the details of all the jobs you have applied for.
